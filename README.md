# Simple-University-Library-System-GUI

## Overview
This is a project for our CS 3330 course at the University of Missouri. We were instructed to create an application that implemented a simple library 
collection and checkout system with a graphics user interface (GUI).
We used the Java language to write our program and used JavaFX and Scene Builder to help with the GUI.

3. Enjoy your new library system!

## Challenges We Faced
This was the first time many of us used JavaFX and Scene Builder so it took some time getting used to the new systems. Scene Builder was fairly straightforward
to use and we all picked it up very quickly, but JavaFX had a steeper learning curve, but by using our resources and viewing templates and examples we were
able to use it successfully in our program. Another challenge was getting the group together and on the same page. But by using our time together wisely we were 
able to split up the work efficiently and made sure everyone knew what was going on. We also utilized Discord to stay in touch and ask for help/feedback from
the group.
